This project is done by Andy Chen Xia as a part of the dissertation.

In order to run the code python needs to be installed with the following packages:
	1. Tensorflow
	2. Numpy
	3. Pandas
	4. Matplotlib

then run it in the command line using python <name of the file>

CNN.py is the python containing the code to run the CNN model implemented in the paper, it generates a CNNpredict.csv file which contains the values predicted by the neural network.

MLP.py is the python containing the code to run the MLP model implemented in the paper, it generates a MLPpredict.csv file which contains the values predicted by the neural network.

LSTM.py is the python containing the code to run the MLP model implemented in the paper, it generates a LSTMpredict.csv file which contains the values predicted by the neural network.
